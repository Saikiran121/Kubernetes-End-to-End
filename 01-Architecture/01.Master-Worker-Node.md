# 01. Master/Worker Node Architecture Overview
      - Kubernetes follows a distributed master-worker architecture where the control plane (master nodes) manages the cluster state
        and worker nodes execute containerized applications
      
      - This design ensures scalability, fault tolerance, and high availability by separating management responsibilities from workload execution.

      - The architecture consists of two main components:
        a. Control Plane (Master Node)
           - Makes global decisions about the cluster, including scheduling and responding to cluster events
        
        b. Worker Nodes
           - Host the pods that run application workloads and execute tasks assigned by the control plane


# 02. Master/Worker Node Concepts
      a. Master (Control Plane) Nodes
         - Act as the “brain” of the cluster.
         - Make decisions (e.g., scheduling pods, responding to API calls).
         - Maintain the desired state of the cluster.
      
      b. Worker Nodes
         - Act as the “muscles” that run your applications in pods.
         - Execute containers, report health, and manage networking for pods.
         - Receive and carry out instructions from the master nodes.
    

# 03. Control Plane Components (on Master Nodes)
      
      a. API Server (kube-apiserver)
         - Central entry point for all Kubernetes commands.
         - Validates and processes REST requests (e.g., kubectl create pod).
         - Stores and retrieves cluster state via etcd.
      
      b. etcd
         - Lightweight, distributed key-value store.
         - Persists the entire cluster’s configuration and state (who, what, where).
         - Offers reliable data replication and recovery through a consensus algorithm.
      
      c. Scheduler (kube-scheduler)
         - Watches for newly created pods without assigned nodes.
         - Chooses the best worker node based on resource needs, affinity rules, and available capacity.
         - Informs the API Server of its placement decision.
      
      d. Controller Manager (kube-controller-manager)
         - Runs “controller loops” that compare actual vs. desired state (e.g., ReplicaSet controller).
         - Takes corrective actions (e.g., launching more pods if replicas are too few).
         - Includes controllers for nodes, endpoints, service accounts, and more.


# 04. Worker Node Components
      
      a. kubelet
         - The node agent that communicates with the API Server.
         - Ensures containers defined in a PodSpec are running and healthy.
         - Reports node and pod status back to the control plane.
      
      b. kube-proxy
         - Manages network rules on the node to handle service traffic.
         - Routes incoming requests to the correct pod IPs, balancing load across replicas.
         - Supports modes like iptables (default) or IPVS for efficient packet forwarding.
      
      c. Container Runtime
         - Underlying engine (e.g., containerd or CRI-O) that pulls images and starts/stops containers.
         - Interfaces with the kubelet via the Container Runtime Interface (CRI).


# 05. This simplified flow shows how Kubernetes organizes and runs your applications:
      - You issue a command (e.g., kubectl run).
      - API Server validates and stores the desired state.
      - Scheduler picks a worker node for any new pods.
      - kubelet on that node starts the container via the container runtime.
      - kube-proxy sets up networking so the pod can communicate.
      - etcd holds the single source of truth; controllers continuously reconcile real vs. desired state.
