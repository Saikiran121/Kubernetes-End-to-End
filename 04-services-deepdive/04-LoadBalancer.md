# 01. LoadBalancer (analogy)
      - LoadBalancer is like hiring a professional doorman and concierge service from your cloud provider
        
        a. Public VIP address
           - The cloud gives you a public-facing IP or hostname (the “VIP”) that everyone on the Internet can use to reach your service.
        
        b. Automatic routing
           - Behind the scenes, traffic to that VIP hits a NodePort on your cluster nodes, then goes through the internal ClusterIP “hallway” and 
             finally to one of your Pods.
        
        c. Managed for you
           - The cloud provider creates and maintains a real load balancer (with health checks, SSL certificates, auto-scaling, etc.), so you don’t 
             have to set it up yourself.
        
        d. Use cases
           - Perfect for production websites or APIs that need a stable public endpoint, built-in failover across Pods and nodes, and easy SSL/TLS 
             management—all handled by the cloud.


# 02. LoadBalancer
      - Purpose: Provision a cloud provider’s external load balancer with a public IP

      - Behavior: Allocates an external VIP, routes traffic → NodePort → ClusterIP → Pods.

      - Use Cases: Production web apps requiring public exposure, high availability, and managed SSL termination.
