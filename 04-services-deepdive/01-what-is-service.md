# 01. Kubernetes Service
      - Kubernetes Services provide stable network endpoints for Pods. They abstract away dynamic Pod IPs, handle load-balancing,
        and expose applications both inside and outside the cluster
      
      - There are 3 primary service types
        a. ClusterIP
        b. NodePort
        c. LoadBalancer
        each suits to different exposure and requirements.
