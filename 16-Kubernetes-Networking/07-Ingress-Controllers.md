# 01. Understanding Ingress: Your Cluster's Front Door
      - An Ingress Controller is like a sophisticated receptionist at a large office building. When visitors (external traffic) arrive, 
        the receptionist knows exactly which floor and office (service) to direct them to based on who they're looking for (hostname/path).
    

# 02. How Ingress Controllers Work
      - The Flow Process: 
        a. External Request: Client makes HTTP/HTTPS request
        b. Ingress Controller: Receives and examines the request
        c. Rule Matching: Matches request to configured routing rules
        d. Service Routing: Forwards traffic to appropriate Kubernetes service
        e. Load Balancing: Distributes traffic among healthy pods


# 03. Popular Ingress Controllers
      a. NGINX Ingress Controller
         - Most popular and widely supported
         - Rich feature set with SSL termination
         - Like having an experienced traffic cop
      
      b. Traefik
         - Modern, cloud-native design
         - Automatic service discovery
         - The "smart" traffic director
      
      c. Istio Ingress Gateway
         - Part of service mesh ecosystem
         - Advanced traffic management
         - Enterprise-grade capabilities


# 04. Ingress Configuration Examples
      
      a. Basic Path-Based Routing is stored at 16-Kubernetes-Networking/08-Basic-Path-Based-Routing.yaml

      b. SSL/TLS Termination is stored at 16-Kubernetes-Networking/09-SSL-TLS-Termination.yaml


# 05. Advanced Ingress Features
      a. Load Balancing Algorithms
         - Round Robin: Requests distributed evenly
         - Least Connections: Route to least busy backend
         - IP Hash: Consistent routing based on client IP
         - Weighted: Distribute based on backend capacity

      b. Advanced Routing
         - Header-based routing
         - Cookie-based routing
         - Geographic routing
         - A/B testing capabilities
