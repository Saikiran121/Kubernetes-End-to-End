# 01. What is ReplicaSet?
      - A ReplicaSet in kubernetes is a controller that makes sure a certain number of identical copies (replicas) of your application, called
        Pods, are always running.


# 02. Real-Life Analogy
      - Imagine you run an ice cream stand at a busy fair:
        a. You decide you need 3 employees at the counter at all times so customers are never left waiting too long.
        b. If one employee calls in sick or leaves for a break, your supervisor's job is to quickly bring in a replacement to keep
           the total at 3


# 03. In Kubernetes terms:
      - Each employee is a Pod (a running copy of your app).
      - The supervisor is the ReplicaSet.
      - You tell the ReplicaSet: "Keep exactly 3 pods running."
      - If a Pod crashes or the server it's on goes down, the ReplicaSet starts a new Pod to fill the gap—automatically.


# 04. Why Is This Useful?
      a. High availability: Your app keeps running even if some Pods fail—users don't notice.
      b. Scalability: You can quickly tell the ReplicaSet to run 5 or 10 Pods if traffic increases.
      c. Self-healing: No need to restart Pods by hand—the replica supervisor handles it.
