# 01. What is Deployment?
      - A Deployment in Kubernetes is a way to automatically manage, update, and maintain a set of application Pods.

      - You can think of it like a controller or manager that:
        a. Creates and runs the desired number of identical Pods (replicas)
        b. Updates your app version with zero downtime
        c. Automatically replaces crashed or failed Pods
        d. Supports rolling updates and rollbacks


# 02. Example
      - A Deployment in kubernetes is like an automated manager for your application's "workers" (Pods).
        Imagine you run a pizza shop:
        a. You want 3 Pizza chefs working at all times
        b. If one chef leaves, your manager (Deployment) immediately brings in another.
        c. If you want to swap recipes (update the chef's script), you give new instructions to the manager, and the manager smoothly replaces
           each old chef with one using the new recipe wihtout closing the shop


# 03. Real-Life Example
      - Suppose your pizza shop runs a website, and you want three identical copies (Pods) running so users always get fast service, even if one 
        copy fails.
        a. You create a Deployment in Kubernetes and specify: “I want 3 replicas of my web app (image: pizza-app:v1) running.”
        b. Kubernetes keeps those 3 Pods alive.
        c. One Pod (server) crashes? Deployment brings up a new one automatically.
        d. You want to update the app with a new logo? Change the Deployment to use pizza-app:v2. Kubernetes will gradually switch the Pods to the 
           new version, making sure the site is always up—even during the update.

--------------------

# 04. Rolling Update

      a. Real-life analogy:
         - Imagine you have a restaurant with 3 chefs (Pods) all making pizza from the same recipe. One day you want to improve the 
           recipe. Instead of firing all chefs at once (risking no pizza for your customers), you retrain them one at a time.
           This way, pizzas keep coming out of the kitchen without interruption.
      
      b. In Kubernetes:
         - A Deployment has, say, 3 Pods. You update your app (New Recipe), and kubernetes replaces them little by little.
           Your apps users never see downtime because some old Pods always stay available while new ones comes up.


# 05. How Does Kubernetes Do This? 
      - When you run this:
        kubectl set image deployment/myapp-deploy myapp=myapp:1.1.0

        Kubernetes doesn’t destroy all old Pods at once. Instead, it:
        a. Starts a new Pod with the new image
        b. Waits for the new Pod to become "Ready"
        c. Only then, kills one of the old Pods
        d. Repeats this process until all old Pods are replaced


# 06. Key controls:
      
      a. maxUnavailable
         - Maximum number of Pods that can be down while updating
         - Example: Set to 1? Only 1 Pod can be unavailable at a time

      b. maxSurge
         - How many extra Pods can be created above the desired count
         - Example: Set to 1? You can have 4 Pods running while rolling from 3→3


# 07. Zero Downtime
      - Kubernetes only removes an old Pod after the replacement is healthy (measured by readiness probes).



# 08. Rollbacks: “Undo” Button for Updates
      - If you discover your new recipe is burning the pizzas (your new version has a bug):
        a. Simple undo:
           - kubectl rollout undo deployment/myapp-deploy
           - Instantly rolls back to the previous working version!
        
        b. See revision history:
           - kubectl rollout history deployment/myapp-deploy
           - Lists all updates (who/when/what was changed) so you can pick a specific past version if needed.


# 09. How Does This Help in Real Life?
      a. No downtime: Users keep getting pizza (service) during updates
      b. Safe updates: Rollout pauses if a new version fails health checks
      c. Easy rollback: Quick undo if something goes wrong—no need to remember the old config


# 10. Advanced Controls (Blue/Purple Belt)
      a. Pause and Resume:
         - Pause a rollout to check the new Pod state before proceeding; resume when ready.
         - kubectl rollout pause deployment/myapp-deploy
           # ...monitor or make changes...
           kubectl rollout resume deployment/myapp-deploy
      
      b. Canary Deployments:
         - Expose the new recipe to only a few customers at first and monitor feedback.
