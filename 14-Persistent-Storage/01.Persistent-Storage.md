# 01. What Is Persistent Storage?
      - Think of Kubernetes containers like hotel rooms, when you check out, everything gets cleaned and reset for the next guest.
        Persistent storage is like having a personal storage unit that keeps your belongings safe even when you switch rooms
      
      - Three key differences:
        
        a. Ephemeral Storage: Dies with the container (like hotel amenities)

        b. Volumes: Shared storage within a pod (like a shared hotel suite)

        c. Persistent Storage: Survives Pod restarts and moves (like your storage unit)


# 02. The Storage Trinity
      
      a. Volume
         - Basic Storage attached to a pod. when the pod dies, the volume dies to.
           
           volumes:
           - name: temp-storage
             emptyDir: {}
      

      b. PersistentVolume (PV)
         - A piece of storage in the cluster, like a hard drive that exists independently of any Pod.
      

      c. PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)
         - A request for storage, like asking for 500GB of fast storage.


# 03. Simple Analogy
      a. PV: Physical parking spaces in a garage

      b. PVC: Your parking request (I need 1 space, covered)

      c. StorageClass: Types of Parkings available("premium covered," "basic outdoor")
